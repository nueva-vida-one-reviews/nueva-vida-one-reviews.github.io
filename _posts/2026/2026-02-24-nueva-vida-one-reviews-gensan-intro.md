About two years ago, through Facebook, we discovered a housing project named Nueva Vida One. It is located in Purok 17, Baranggay Mabuhay, General Santos City. We traveled for 3-4 hours to be able to view the location and the model house. 

We liked it. So we went back to the developer's office and decided to pay the reservation fee And in the next months paid the processing fee (or downpayment).

Last September 2025, we attended a conference in GenSan, and before going home decided to do a quick visit of the unit we were paying for.

We were very disappointed. That time was maybe a few weeks before the finishing touches is to be made, but we already saw defects in the house --- defects which I suspected will just be temporarily hidden when the construction workers will do the finishing touches. (I'm going to make a separate post of the defects we discovered during that time.)

In the next few days and weeks, we made phone calls to the housing developer's office (NationBuilders). Their representative said that they will do the necessary fixes before the turnover.

February 2026. 

During the day the housing unit was turned over to us, which was 2-3 weeks ago, we expected that the defects we pointed out to them months prior were already fixed.

Some were fixed. (But like I said above, I suspect the fixes are just temporary, and might show up again in the next few months. I will post updates here.)

The obvious defects, which we did not bother to bring up during the calls to the developer's office, were never fixed. Examples are:

- Door knobs with no strike plate.
- Screws securing the doorknob's faceplate to the door are wobbly. They do not fit in the screw holes.
- Light bulb socket not screwed properly to the ceiling.
- Missing adjustment screws in the concealed cabinet door hinges.
- etc.

Those lapses gave us the impression that the Engineer, or whoever is in charge of checking the house before the day of turnover, was not doing his job properly.

When we decided to acquire this house,we were expecting the house to last for 20 to 30 years. It seems to me that it will last defect free for only about 2 years, or less. But I'm still hoping that I'm mistaken.

Updates about the house, and maybe of neighboring houses, will be posted here.
